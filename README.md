### Hi there 👋

What's up, people? My name is Joan from Colombia and I'm really excited seeing you guys here checking my profile. I feel really flattered 😏 I hope my Spring Boot and Angular experience can suprise you, since those are my favorite frameworks 💕 (Java Lover), however, I've been working on TypeSctipt as well (Such a beautiful language) 👀 And those are not the only things I have experience in. I love the Internet and all its fundamentals, so I have a good understanding in today's web applications, team workflows and the modern software development cycle.
